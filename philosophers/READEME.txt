The project likely involves creating multiple threads, each corresponding to 
a philosopher, and using mutexes to control access to shared data (such as fork
availability, philosopher state, meal count). The simulation proceeds by 
allowing philosophers to alternate between thinking, eating, and sleeping, with 
synchronization mechanisms to prevent conflicts and ensure fair resource 
allocation (e.g., preventing deadlocks or starvation).

The t_data structure holds all the shared data necessary for synchronization 
and coordination between philosophers. Each t_philo structure represents an 
individual philosopher and contains its specific information and synchronization
 mechanisms.

The overall logic of the project would involve creating threads for each 
philosopher, implementing the dining philosophers algorithm, handling thread 
synchronization, and monitoring the termination conditions (e.g., meal limit 
reached).

pthread_mutex_t is a type representing a mutex (short for mutual exclusion). 
A mutex is a synchronization primitive used to protect shared resources from 
concurrent access by multiple threads. It allows only one thread to lock 
(or acquire) the mutex at a time, while other threads that attempt to lock 
the mutex will be blocked until it becomes available. 

pthread_t is a type representing a thread identifier. It is used to uniquely 
identify a thread created by the pthread_create function. A thread identifier 
can be used to perform operations related to the thread, such as joining threads
with pthread_join, detaching threads with pthread_detach, or comparing thread 
identifiers with pthread_equal. Thread identifiers are used to manage and 
interact with individual threads in a multithreaded program.

In C, the dot (.) operator is used to access members of a structure when you 
have a direct instance of the structure. On the other hand, the arrow (->) 
operator is used to access members of a structure when you have a pointer to 
the structure.
